# SimpleChat
Simple Chat App Demo without network connectivity.

This project demonstrates a simple chat screen flow where conversations are presented in an inbox view, and chats are presented in a chat view so new messages can be posted and received.
The project simulates the initial conversations and mimicks a WebSocket approach to dynamically send and recieve messages when in a conversation.  The WebSocket components are to be added later.
The chat view uses an AsyncStream method to send and recieve new messages.  This approach could also be applied to the inbox view to handle new message updates so the list re-orders according to the latest message update.
