# SimpleChat
Simple Chat App Demo without network connectivity.

This project demonstrates a simple chat screen flow where conversations are presented in an inbox view, and chats are presented in a chat view so new messages can be posted and received.
The project simulates the intial conversations and mimicks a WenSocket approach to dynamically send and recieve messages when in a conversation.  The WebSocket components are to be added later.
